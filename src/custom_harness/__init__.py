"""Custom Harness — a production-ready, general-purpose agentic coding harness.

Provides a Python-native LLM agent with comprehensive tool use, modeled after
Claude Code and Codex CLI. Not biased toward any benchmark — this is a
general-purpose assistant that can write code, create files, search codebases,
and execute shell commands.

Modules:
    config   — Model, timeout, and token configuration constants.
    prompt   — System prompt template.
    tools    — Tool declarations (Gemini FunctionDeclaration) and implementations.
    loop     — Core ReAct agent loop with retry, doom-loop detection.
    agent    — CustomHarnessAgent (subclasses BaseAgent for pipeline integration).
