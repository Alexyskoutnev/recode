"""Zipper schedule splitter for GDPval.

Splits the 220-task GDPval dataset into 10 slices of 22 tasks each:
  - 8 dev slices  (S1–S8): for iterative development and tuning.
  - 2 eval slices (E1–E2): held-out evaluation, run only at the end.

Tasks are assigned round-robin by occupation so every slice gets a
representative mix of occupations.

    """Split GDPval into 8 dev slices + 2 eval slices (22 tasks each).

    The split is fully deterministic (no randomness) so all agents
    are evaluated on the exact same set of tasks per slice.

    Algorithm:
    1. Group samples by occupation (44 occupations, 5 tasks each).
    2. Sort occupations alphabetically.
    3. Sort tasks within each occupation by task ID.
    4. Flatten into a single ordered list (occupation-major order).
    5. Round-robin assign tasks across 10 slices so each slice gets
       a representative mix of occupations.
    6. First 8 slices are dev (S1–S8), last 2 are eval (E1–E2).

    Args:
        samples: List of GDPval samples (must be exactly 220).
