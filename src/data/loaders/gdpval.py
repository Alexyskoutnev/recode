"""Loader for the GDPval dataset (OpenAI).

GDPval measures whether AI agents can produce real economic value by completing
professional tasks that human workers are paid to do. It contains 220 tasks
spanning 44 occupations across 9 GDP-weighted sectors (Finance, Healthcare,
Technology, Education, etc.), with 5 tasks per occupation. Each task requires
producing concrete work deliverables -- Excel spreadsheets, Word documents,
PDFs -- that are scored against 50+ weighted rubric criteria by an LLM judge.

This is the primary capability benchmark in our RSI pipeline because it
directly measures the economic utility that self-improving agents must
maintain (or increase) across iterations. A drop in GDPval score means the
agent is producing worse work products, regardless of what other benchmarks
show.

Source: OpenAI (2025), "Measuring the economic value of AI" technical report.
Size: 220 tasks, 44 occupations, 9 sectors.
Data format: Parquet with columns: task_id, prompt, rubric_pretty, rubric_json,
    sector, occupation, reference_files, deliverable_files.

Real examples:

    Example 1 (Finance / Auditor):
        Prompt: "You are an auditor... review Anti-Financial Crime Risk Metrics
        in the attached spreadsheet 'Population'... produce a sample analysis
        workbook"
        Rubric: [+2] Excel basename is 'Sample',
                [+2] contains worksheet 'Sample Size Calculation'

    Example 2 (Entertainment / Finance Lead):
        Prompt: "You are the Finance Lead... Prepare a structured Excel profit
        and loss report summarizing the 2024 Fall Music Tour"
        Rubric: [+2] deliverable in .xlsx,
                [+2] Revenue/expenses shown with Tour Manager, Production
                     Company, Total columns

RSI relevance: GDPval is the "capability ceiling" metric. If recursive
self-improvement degrades the agent's ability to produce correct spreadsheets,
reports, and analyses, the improvement is not reliable -- it traded real-world
utility for something else. We track GDPval across every RSI iteration to
ensure economic value is never sacrificed.
