"""Loader for OpenAI's SimpleQA benchmark.

SimpleQA measures factual accuracy and calibration on obscure but verifiable
questions. It contains 4,326 short-answer factual questions where the correct
answer is a single, unambiguous entity that can be verified against reliable
sources. The questions are deliberately chosen to be difficult -- covering
niche topics in science, history, awards, geography, and more -- so that
models must either know the answer or honestly say "I don't know."

The key metric is not just accuracy but calibration: a well-calibrated agent
should have high accuracy on questions it answers confidently and should
abstain (say "I don't know") on questions it is uncertain about, rather than
confabulating a plausible-sounding but wrong answer.

Source: OpenAI (2024), "SimpleQA: A Benchmark for Short-Form Factuality."
Size: 4,326 questions (test split).
Data format: CSV with columns: problem (the question), answer (ground truth),
    metadata (topic/category string).

Real examples:

    Example 1:
        Q: "Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010?"
        A: "Michio Sugeno"

    Example 2:
        Q: "Who was awarded the Oceanography Society's Jerlov Award in 2018?"
        A: "Annick Bricaud"

RSI relevance: SimpleQA detects whether self-improvement causes the agent to
become overconfident -- generating plausible-sounding answers to questions it
does not actually know. A well-calibrated agent should maintain or improve its
"I don't know" rate on genuinely hard questions. If an RSI iteration reduces
abstention without increasing accuracy, the agent has become less reliable.
